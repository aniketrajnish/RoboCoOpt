### Robot Co-optimization using planar linkage
The base code implements the planar linkage kinematics in `linkage.py`, and the linkage can be installed on a robot and simulate to test the robot performance using `linkage_physics.py`.  Finally, we implemented a basic linkage optimizer using simulated annealing in `optimizer_anneal.py`.

### My Contribution

#### Day 0
- Cloned the repo, created a venv for the project, installed the required packages, solved various dependency issues.
- Since I'm not using conda, my resolution to the issues associated with `Box2D` was to install some additional dependencies like `swig` and `box2d-py` using `pip`.
- Ran `linkage.py`, `optimizer_anneal.py` and `linkage_physics.py` to verify the installation and the working of the code.
- Studied the codebase to understand the implementation of the planar linkage kinematics, the simulated annealing optimizer, and the linkage physics simulation.

#### Day 1
- To see the best possible results being generated by the optimizer for 1000 steps, I  automated the process of running the optimizer and kept a track of the best results by updating the `.pickle` file if the current score is greater than the high score.
- The best fitness score I got after 8 iterations was `~10.77` after 28 iterations of the optimizer.
- I created a simple GUI around this functionality to keep track of all the results and the best result using `PyQt5`.

#### Day 2
- Let the tool run for the entire day, achieved a fitness score of `~25.5`
- Implemented genetic algorithms by Tina Wu.

#### Day 3
- Fixed several bugs associated with genetic algo, improved upon the code design.
- Integrated `.pickle` export functionality to visualize the results in `pygame`.
- Current fitness score is in the ballpark of `2-5`
- Need to work on defining our own `crossover` and `mutation` implementation for genetic algorithms to function correctly.
- Dk why the wheels are suddenly so big with no change to the codebase ðŸ’€

#### Install

The code has been tested on Python 3.6 and 3.12. 

To run the code, you first need to install Anaconda, which can be downloaded from https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/

Once Anaconda is installed, you can open the anaconda and type the following commands in order:

1. now, you can create your conda environment, named "box2d-py"
   
`conda create -n box2d-py`

2. remember every time you activate the environment, before you use it.
   
`conda activate box2d-py`

3. once you activate the environment for the first time, you need to install the following packages.

`conda install conda-forge::box2d-py` (box2d-py (https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d). Fortunately, you can install it via Anaconda.)
   
`pip install pygame`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install vapory`

4. run the Python scripts one by one
    
`python linkage.py`

`python optimizer_anneal.py`

`python linkage_physics.py`

### About linkage_physics.py

To run linkage_physics.py, you need the 'best.pickle' file that contains the design from optimizer_anneal.py. That said, before you run optimizer_anneal.py, you do not have it yet. 

If you want to simply test the linkage_physics.py, instead, you can replace 

`robot=create_robot('best.pickle', sep=5.)`

with 

`link=Linkage.createSimple()`

`robot=create_robot(link, sep=5.) `

Once you run linkage_physics.py, you can control the robots via

press 'SPACE' to turn on/off simulation

press 'RCTRL' to turn on/off robot motor


### Installing Povray on Windows

On windows, the default povray does not work. We need a special version of povray that is independently compiled called MegaPov.
I have included a version of this MegaPov in the project, i.e., the megapov.rar. To enable povray on windows, unzip this folder to any directory.
Let's say you have a povray.exe located in "C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Roaming\POV-Ray\bin".
After this step, you need to add this to your system path as follows:

#### Note that you might need to restart the system to let the setting enabled.


Now you can press "LSHIFT" in the window to have the povray render a nice image for you, an example is as follows:
