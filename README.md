### Robot Co-optimization using planar linkage
The base code implements the planar linkage kinematics in `linkage.py`, and the linkage can be installed on a robot and simulate to test the robot performance using `linkage_physics.py`.  Finally, we implemented a basic linkage optimizer using simulated annealing in `optimizer_anneal.py`.

#### Install
To run the code, you just need to install the packages as defined in environment.yml. But it is recommended to use the conda environment by typing:

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

`conda activate myenv`
