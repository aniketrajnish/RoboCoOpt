### Robot Co-optimization using planar linkage
The base code implements the planar linkage kinematics in `linkage.py`, and the linkage can be installed on a robot and simulate to test the robot performance using `linkage_physics.py`.  Finally, we implemented a basic linkage optimizer using simulated annealing in `optimizer_anneal.py`.

### My Contribution

#### Day 0
- Cloned the repo, created a venv for the project, installed the required packages, solved various dependency issues.
- Since I'm not using conda, my resolution to the issues associated with `Box2D` was to install some additional dependencies like `swig` and `box2d-py` using `pip`.
- Ran `linkage.py`, `optimizer_anneal.py` and `linkage_physics.py` to verify the installation and the working of the code.
- Studied the codebase to understand the implementation of the planar linkage kinematics, the simulated annealing optimizer, and the linkage physics simulation.

#### Day 1
- To see the best possible results being generated by the optimizer for 1000 steps, I  automated the process of running the optimizer and kept a track of the best results by updating the `.pickle` file if the current score is greater than the high score.
- The best fitness score I got after 8 iterations was `~10.77` after 28 iterations of the optimizer.
- I created a simple GUI around this functionality to keep track of all the results and the best result using `PyQt5`.

#### Day 2
- Let the tool run for the entire day, achieved a fitness score of `~25.5`
- Implemented genetic algorithms by Tina Wu.

#### Day 3
- Fixed several bugs associated with genetic algo, improved upon the code design.
- Integrated `.pickle` export functionality to visualize the results in `pygame`.
- Current fitness score is in the ballpark of `2-5`
- Need to work on defining our own `crossover` and `mutation` implementation for genetic algorithms to function correctly.
- Dk why the wheels are suddenly so big with no change to the codebase ðŸ’€

#### Day 4
- Implemented parallel processing for the genetic algorithm to speed up the process.
- Fixed the issue with the wheels being too big.
- Implemented the custom `crossover` and `mutation` functions to improve the results by the genetic algorithm.
- Fitness score of `~24.05` achieved after over 100 generations with a population size of 100 in each generation.

#### Day 5
- Converted the project structure into that of python package.
- Extended the trainer gui to include the genetic algorithm functionality as well as accepting parameters for both algorithms.
